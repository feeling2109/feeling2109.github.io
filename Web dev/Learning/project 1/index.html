        <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
        <p>You are visiting my site. This is a place I test one of my very first pages in <b><u><i>HTML</i></u></b>. Mostly, it's just text for now and quite boring.</p>
        <p> <a href="nextpage.html">Here is what I've learned so far</a></p>
        <p>You can signup to be my buddy, just click <a href="Register1.html" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
        <p>That's it for now, I hope i would get further later on.</p>
        <p>Oh, here an image for you, I think it's fun</p>
