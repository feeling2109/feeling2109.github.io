Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 

--Selectors
.class
#id
* = select everything
element (el)
el1 , el2   = applies for both el1 and el2;
el1 > el2   = applies for el2 w/ its parent is el1;
el1   el2   = applies only for el2 inside el1;
el1 + el2   = applies for one el2 which is right after el1;
el1 ~ el2   = appies for all following el2 after el1;
:hover      = suffix applied when hover cursor on;
:last-child = applies only for last child of element;
:nth-child( 'number of order') = applies for ...th child in order of element;
:first-child = applies only for first child of element;
:only-child = applies for the only child in element;
:nth-last-child(A) = select last element counting from the bottom up;
span:first-of-type = select first element of a type;
:nth-of-type(A) = select specific element / A = number - odd/even;
:nth-of-type(An+B) = select every A nth element from the B nth;
:only-of-type = select only type of an element;
:empty = select element with no children;
:not(X) = select element that does not has 'X';

[attribute] - e.g *[for] = select all elements with attribute 'for' ;
[attribute="value"] - e.g *[for=Alice] = select all elements with attribute for=Alice ;
[attribute^="value"] = Select all elements with an attribute value that starts with specific characters;
[attribute$="value"] = Select all elements with an attribute value that ends with specific characters;
[attribute*="value"] = Select all elements with an attribute value that contains specific characters anywhere;


!important  = overrides cascading order (not reccommended);


--You can combine the class selector with other selectors, like the type selector.
Examples
ul.important selects all ul elements that have class="important"
#big.wide selects all elements with id="big" that also have class="wide"


--What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order

--Relative Units
EM: Relative to the parent element
REM: Relative to the root element (HTML tag)
%: Relative to the parent element
VW: Relative to the viewport’s width
VH: Relative to the viewport’s height

--Flexbox
display: flex;
flex-direction: row/row-reverse/center/column/column/reverse;
justify-content(horizontal): center/flex-start/flex-end/space-around/space-between;
align-items(vertical): center/flex-start/flex-end/space-around/space-between;
*Note: when Flex-direction is column, justif-content and align-items are exchanged in directions.
order: (+/-interger) = move items to new position;
align-self: = similar to align-items but to one specific item;
align-content: center/flex-start/flex-end/space-around/space-between = determines apcing between lines ( if there is only one line this has no effect);
flex-wrap: nowrap/wrap/wrap-reverse;
flex-flow: = combination of flex-direction and flex-wrap - - e.g: row wrap/ column wrap-reverse;

--Transition:
transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
